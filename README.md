## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'quiet-places'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install quiet-places

## Usage

Start the program in your terminal with `ruby bin/quiet-places`. On starting, WordWise will choose a word and several definitions, one of which is correct. (This process may take a few seconds). Once you've made your choice, type the corresponding number and hit 'enter'. WordWise will tell you if you're correct and, if not, the correct definition. Type 'o' and 'enter' to see the word's origin (etymology) or 'n' and 'enter' for the next question. To exit the game, type 'e' and 'enter'. Watch a video demo at <https://bit.ly/2Kz8zgX>.
