# QuietPlaces

Find where to converse and relax, in peace. Read reviews of restaurants and bars and make your own. QuietPlaces is an MVC Sinatra content management system that allows users to find quality places without the noise that can prevent people from hearing others and being heard and detract from their enjoyment.

## Installation

You can either clone the repository directly from GitHub into a local directory on your computer or you can Fork the app so that you can contribute to the code.

Once you Fork or Clone this app, cd into that directory and then execute:

*bash:*

```bash
bundle install
rake db:migrate
```

Because the app uses the Dotenv gem for environment variable for security, create a file in the top level of the directory, with a .env extension. This file should not be checked into a public repository. In this file, set the values you want to ensure user and admin login secrets, which will be accessible in the ENV hash. For example:

*config.env:*

```
SECRET_KEY=YOURSECRETKEYHERE
ADMIN_KEY=YOURADMINKEYHERE
```

Then,

*bash:*

```bash
export SECRET_KEY=YOURSECRETKEYHERE
export ADMIN_KEY=YOURADMINKEYHERE
```

Please note, the included tests specify the ADMIN_KEY as "149162". Either use this value while testing or change the value in the tests in your fork.

For further documentation on Dotenv, see
<https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv/blob/master/README.md>
