# Video Demo Transcript

Have you ever gone out to a restaurant or bar, hoping for a moment of peace or a good conversation, but when you get there, it's just too loud? There could be a TV or sound system going full blast or maybe it's packed full of noisy people and you have to shout for a person 2 feet away to hear you.

If this sounds familiar, make QuietPlaces your place to go before going out! You can see a list of reviews of restaurants and bars focusing on both noise level and overall quality.

To see a list of places in the database, go to the Places tab at the top of the page. [click Places]

Here you'll see a list of places in alphabetical order. Click on a place's name to see more. [click Tavern On the Blue]

Here we have Tavern On the Blue, with its address, its category, which is "bar", its website, the user who added it, and its list of reviews. Read a review by clicking its title. [click "Could hear a pin drop"]

You can see if a TV was on, the volume in the establishment, the overall quality of the experience, and user comments.

You can do all this without being logged in, but if you want to add a place to the database or write a review, you'll need to sign up. Just click the Sign Up tab. [click Sign Up]
